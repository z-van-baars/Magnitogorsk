# Magnitogorsk

You play as a mid-level bureaucrat placed in charge of a steel mill
in a communist state "loosely based" on the U.S.S.R. in the middle 
of the 20th century.

Every month you receive your production orders and you have 4 weeks to manage
resources in order to meet your quota - or face the consequences!
